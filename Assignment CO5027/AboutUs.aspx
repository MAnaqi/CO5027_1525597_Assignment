        <h1>Nike</h1>
        <p>Nike, originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), 
            was founded by University of Oregon track athlete Phil Knight and his coach Bill Bowerman in January 1964. 
            The company initially operated as a distributor for Japanese shoe maker Onitsuka Tiger (now ASICS), making most sales at track meets out of Knight's automobile.</p>
        <h1>New Balance</h1>
        <p>In 1906, William J. Riley, British emigrant, founded the New Balance Arch Support Company, 
            manufacturing arch supports and other accessories designed to improve shoe fit in the Boston area. His first product, a flexible arch support, was designed with three support points to provide greater balance and comfort in the shoe. 
            It is believed that Riley came up with the name "New Balance" by observing chickens in his yard and demonstrated the way his arch supports worked by keeping a chicken foot on his office desk. 
            He explained to customers that the chicken's three-pronged foot resulted in perfect balance. In 1927, Riley hired Arthur Hall to be a salesman. In 1934, Hall became a business partner and found his niche by marketing to people whose jobs required them to spend a lot of time standing. 
            In 1956, Hall sold the business to his daughter Eleanor and her husband Paul Kidd.</p>
